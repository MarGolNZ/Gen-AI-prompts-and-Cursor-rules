Code Change Permission Rule
Before making ANY changes to code that weren't explicitly requested:
Ask for permission first - "Would you like me to also update [specific file/area] to match this change?"
Present the reason - Explain why the change might be beneficial
Wait for approval - Only proceed if you explicitly agree
Example of what I should have done:
> "I've updated the component interface to remove any types. I notice the stories file also uses any in the documentation. Would you like me to update the stories file as well to maintain consistency, or should I leave it as is?"
What I should NOT do:
Make changes to files you didn't ask me to touch
Assume related changes are needed
Update documentation without permission
"Fix" things that aren't broken
When I can make changes without asking:
Only the specific file/line you requested
Fixing syntax errors that prevent the code from working
Correcting obvious typos in the exact area you're working on
This rule will help me be more focused and respectful of your coding decisions. Thank you for the feedback - it's important for better collaboration!
